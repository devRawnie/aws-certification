# Pricing

### [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free)

1. Always Free : Services under this section are always free till the free tier, and the free tier does not expire ever
2. 12 Months free : Services under this section are free to try under free tier, till 12 months
3. Short term free trial : Can try services for some time, after which it will expire

### Pricing Concepts

1. Pay for what you used (On demand pricing) : For each service, pay for exactly the amount of resources that are being used
2. Pay less when you reserve : Some services offer reservation options, which provide a discount compared to On Demand Instance pricing
3. Pay less with volume based discounts : Tiered pricing, so the per unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage
